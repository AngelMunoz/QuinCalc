# QuinCalc
Just ignore it too

Quincalc Is a small sample of a Universal Windows Platform Using Entity Framework Core, SQLite.

It is Supposed to be some sort of Todo App and a Biweekly Expense Calculator

I've Given some try to UWP apps before but It seems to be finally clicking now

I've been playing with Databinding, Navigation, Navigation Passing Data.

It's not perfect there is room to improve, switch certain XAML Tags with custom UserControl Items,
also Better UI/UX Design for the Layout

But Hey, I Can take it as an mvp for Quincalc.
